  "Whole grains offer a \u201ccomplete package\u201d of health benefits, unlike refined grains, which are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process.",
  "The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat\u2019s B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.",
  "The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1]\u00a0However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains:",

  "Protein is an essential macronutrient, but not all food sources of protein are created equal, and you may not need as much as you think. Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods. ",
  "Protein is found throughout the body\u2014in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.",
  "Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don\u2019t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids\u2014histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine\u2014known as the\u00a0essential\u00a0amino acids, must come from food.",
  "The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake\u2014anywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there\u2019s relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. Individual needs will vary based on factors such as age, exercise level, health conditions, and overall dietary pattern. A registered dietitian can help determine one\u2019s individual protein needs.",
  "In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.",
  "However, it\u2019s uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there\u2019s an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3] ",
  "When we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It\u2019s this protein\u00a0\u201cpackage\u201d\u00a0that\u2019s likely to make a difference for health.",

You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here\u2019s the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death.",
  "To give you an idea, this \u201cscorecard\u201d from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken\u00a0and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it\u2019s also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination.",

  "A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon blood sugar, which can help keep appetite in check. Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits like apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables may even promote weight loss. [1] Their low glycemic loads prevent blood sugar spikes that can increase hunger.",
  "At least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially hundreds of different plant compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in order to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs.

Berries, apples, pears, soy, and cauliflower were associated with weight loss while starchier vegetables like potatoes, corn, and peas were linked with weight gain. [1] However, keep in mind that adding more produce into the diet won\u2019t necessarily help with weight loss unless it replaces another food, such as refined carbohydrates of white bread and crackers.",
  "Fruits and vegetables contain indigestible fiber, which absorbs water and expands as it passes through the digestive system. This can calm symptoms of an irritable bowel and, by triggering regular bowel movements, can relieve or prevent constipation.

  "Fat and cholesterol can\u2019t dissolve in water or blood. Instead, the body packages fat and cholesterol into tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins can transport a lot of fat; they mix easily with blood and flow with it. Some of these particles are big and fluffy, while others are small and dense. The most important ones are low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL) , and triglycerides.",
  "Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to the rest of the body. Cells latch onto these particles and extract fat and cholesterol from them. When there is too much LDL cholesterol in the blood, these particles can form deposits in the walls of the coronary arteries and other arteries throughout the body. Such deposits, called plaque, can narrow arteries and limit blood flow. When plaque breaks apart, it can cause a heart attack or stroke. Because of this, LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad, or harmful, cholesterol.",
  "High-density lipoproteins (HDL) scavenge cholesterol from the bloodstream, from LDL, and from artery walls and ferry it back to the liver for disposal. Think of HDL as the garbage trucks of the bloodstream. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as good, or protective, cholesterol.",
  "Triglycerides make up most of the fat that you eat and that travels through the bloodstream. As the body\u2019s main vehicle for transporting fats to cells, triglycerides are important for good health, though high levels of triglycerides can be unhealthy.",
  "In general, the lower your LDL and the higher your HDL, the better your chances of preventing heart disease and other chronic conditions.",
  "The types of fat in the diet help determine the amount of total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. The types and amount of carbohydrate in the diet also play a role. Cholesterol in food matters, too, but not nearly as much.",

  "In the U.S., the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) develops nutrient reference values called the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamins and minerals. [1] These are intended as a guide for good nutrition and as a scientific basis for the development of food guidelines in both the U.S. and Canada. The DRIs are specific to age, gender, and life stages, and cover more than 40 nutrient substances. The guidelines are based on available reports of deficiency and toxicity of each nutrient. Learn more about vitamins and minerals and their recommended intakes in the table below.",
  "Vitamins and their precise requirements have been controversial since their discovery in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It was the combined efforts of epidemiologists, physicians, chemists, and physiologists that led to our modern day understanding of vitamins and minerals. After years of observation, experiments, and trial and error, they were able to distinguish that some diseases were not caused by infections or toxins\u2014a common belief at the time\u2014but by vitamin deficiencies.

  "Water is an essential nutrient at every age, so optimal hydration is a key component for good health. Water accounts for about 60% of an adult\u2019s body weight. We drink fluids when we feel thirst, the major signal alerting us when our body runs low on water. We also customarily drink beverages with meals to help with digestion.

  "Like most trends of the moment, alkaline water has become popular through celebrity backing with claims ranging from weight loss to curing cancer. The theory behind alkaline water is the same as that touting the benefits of eating alkaline foods, which purportedly counterbalances the health detriments caused by eating acid-producing foods like meat, sugar, and some grains.",
  "From a scale of 0-14, a higher pH number is alkaline; a lower pH is acidic. The body tightly regulates blood pH levels to about 7.4 because veering away from this number to either extreme can cause negative side effects and even be life-threatening. However, diet alone cannot cause these extremes; they most commonly occur with conditions like uncontrolled diabetes, kidney disease, chronic lung disease, or alcohol abuse.",
  "Alkaline water has a higher pH of about 8-9 than tap water of about 7, due to a higher mineral or salt content. Some water sources can be naturally alkaline if the water picks up minerals as it passes over rocks. However, most commercial brands of alkaline water have been manufactured using an ionizer that reportedly separates out the alkaline components and filters out the acid components, raising the pH. Some people add an alkaline substance like baking soda to regular water.",
  "Scientific evidence is not conclusive on the acid-alkaline theory, also called the acid-ash theory, stating that eating a high amount of certain foods can slightly lower the pH of blood especially in the absence of eating foods supporting a higher alkaline blood pH like fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Controlled clinical trials have not shown that diet alone can significantly change the blood pH of healthy people. Moreover, a direct connection of blood pH in the low-normal range and chronic disease in humans has not been established.",
  "A healthy body is designed to send thirst signals when the body becomes depleted of fluids. Thirst is the desire to drink, and is not only driven by physiological cues but behavioral cues.

  "Long-term observational studies show that regular consumption of LCS beverages reduces calorie intake and promotes less weight gain or weight maintenance, but other research shows no effect, and some studies even show weight gain. [9] Randomized controlled trials also show mixed findings, although most have shown a modest reduction in weight. [10] Most of these studies are short-term with a small number of participants, making it difficult to provide definitive conclusions on LCS beverages and weight control. Different comparisons among studies may also produce different results; for example, was LCS beverage intake being compared with SSBs, juice, or water?",
  "The human brain responds to sweetness with signals to eat more. By providing a sweet taste without any calories, however, LCS beverages may cause us to crave more sweet foods and drinks, which can add up to excess calories. Although hypothetical and not proven in human studies, research is actively looking at proposed mechanisms of LCS beverages that may affect appetite and weight:",

  "In most people, the kidneys have trouble keeping up with excess sodium in the blood. As sodium accumulates, the body holds onto water to dilute the sodium. This increases both the amount of fluid surrounding cells and the volume of blood in the bloodstream. Increased blood volume means more work for the heart and more pressure on blood vessels. Over time, the extra work and pressure can stiffen blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. It can also lead to heart failure. There is some evidence that too much salt can damage the heart, aorta, and kidneys without increasing blood pressure, and that it may be bad for bones, too. Learn more about the health risks and disease related to salt and sodium:",
  "After conducting a review on sodium research, the Institute of Medicine concluded that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure, but evidence of a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is inconclusive. [2] It is clear, however, that high blood pressure is a leading cause of CVD. It accounts for two-thirds of all strokes and half of heart disease. [3] In China, high blood pressure is the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for more than one million deaths a year. [4]",

Salt sensitivity is reported to be more prevalent in patients with CKD due to a reduced ability to excrete sodium, which may lead to increased blood pressure. [14]",
  "Although there is evidence that links high sodium intake with high blood pressure, there is not adequate evidence that a low sodium restriction protects against or causes better outcomes of CKD than a moderate sodium restriction. One systematic review of patients diagnosed with CKD found that high sodium intakes of greater than 4,600 mg a day were associated with progression of CKD, but low sodium intakes less than 2,300 mg a day had no significant effect when compared with moderate sodium intakes of 2,300-4,600 mg a day.

So a diet high in sodium could have an additional unwanted effect\u2014the bone-thinning disease known as osteoporosis. [3] A study in post-menopausal women showed that the loss of hip bone density over two years was related to the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion at the start of the study, and that the connection with bone loss was as strong as that for calcium intake.

  "Sea salt is produced by evaporating ocean or sea water. It is also composed mostly of sodium chloride, but sometimes contains small amounts of minerals like potassium, zinc, and iron depending on where it was harvested. Because it is not highly refined and ground like table salt, it may appear coarser and darker with an uneven color, indicating the remaining impurities and nutrients. Unfortunately, some of these impurities can contain metals found in the ocean, like lead. The coarseness and granule size will vary by brand.",
  "Larger, coarser salt granules do not dissolve as easily or evenly in cooking, but offer a burst of flavor. They are best used sprinkled onto meats and vegetables before cooking or immediately after. They should not be used in baking recipes. Keep in mind that measurements of different salts are not always interchangeable in recipes. Generally, sea salt and table salt can be interchanged if the granule size is similar. However, table salt tends to have more concentrated, saltier flavor than kosher salt, so the substitution is one teaspoon of table salt for about 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of kosher salt depending on the brand.",

To explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the glycemic index was developed and is considered a better way of categorizing carbohydrates, especially starchy foods.",
  "The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 based on how quickly and how much they raise blood sugar levels after eating. Foods with a high glycemic index, like white bread, are rapidly digested and cause substantial fluctuations in blood sugar.

  "Soluble fiber may also lower blood cholesterol by interfering with bile acid production. Cholesterol is used to make bile acids in the liver. Soluble fiber binds to bile acids in the gut and excretes them from the body. Because of this reduced amount of available bile acids, the liver will pull cholesterol from the blood to make new bile acids, thereby lowering blood cholesterol. [3] A meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials found a modest benefit of dietary soluble fiber in lowering total and LDL cholesterol. [4]",

  "Constipation is generally defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week, difficulty or pain passing bowel movements, or small hard \u201cpebbly\u201d stool. Occasional bouts of constipation are common, but chronic constipation that does not resolve can lower quality of life and lead to symptoms of bloating, cramping, and even nausea. Chronic constipation increases the risk of diverticular disease and hemorrhoids.",
  "Lifestyle behaviors that help relieve constipation include eating more fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; drinking more water; and regular exercise. There are various reasons why fiber reduces constipation. Some types of soluble fiber bind to water, creating a gel that helps to soften and bulk stool. Insoluble fibers mildly irritate the intestinal lining, which stimulates the secretion of water and mucus to encourage movement of stool. [26] Certain fibers act as prebiotics, or food for gut bacteria, which ferments fibers into short chain fatty acids and increases water in the intestines to produce softer, easier-to-pass stools. [26]",
  "Because of the differing actions of various fiber types with constipation, a range of high-fiber foods from whole grains, fruits, legumes, and vegetables is recommended. It is suggested to increase fiber intake gradually, because a sudden significant increase in dietary fiber can cause bloating and cramping. Drinking more fluids while eating more fiber can also help lessen these side effects.",

[17] The risk of developing diverticulosis increases with age (more than half of people over age 60 have diverticula) and is usually silent, not causing noticeable symptoms unless the pouches tear or become inflamed, leading to diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause persistent abdominal pain (usually in the lower left side), nausea, vomiting, and fever. Treatment is typically a brief period of no food, drinking liquids only, and antibiotic medications. In severe cases where an abscess or perforation may develop, surgery may be needed. However, most people who develop diverticulosis will not develop diverticulitis, with more recent studies estimating only 5% progressing to diverticulitis. [18]",
  "Research shows that a Westernized diet low in fiber and high in red meat and ultra-processed refined foods is a major contributor. [19-21] An eating pattern such as this can lead to constipation, which over time weakens the colon muscles while increasing pressure when trying to defecate; small pouches can form within these weak spots. It can also lead to an increase in harmful intestinal bacteria, causing inflammation and further increasing the risk of diverticular disease. [17,20]",
  "Large cohort studies show a protective effect of fiber on diverticular disease, particularly fibers from fruits, cereal grains, and vegetables. [22,23] A cohort of more than 43,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a protective effect of dietary fiber from diverticulitis, especially cellulose, a type of insoluble fiber. [24] Cellulose is found in the skins of fruits, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, legumes, and wheat bran. A Nurses\u2019 Health Study following more than 50,000 women found that those with the highest fiber intakes (25 or more grams daily) had a 13% lower risk of diverticulitis than those who ate the least (less than 18 grams daily).

  "\u201cSustainability\u201d can be hard to define as it can mean different things based on the context in which it\u2019s discussed. However, the concept is much more than a trending buzzword. The most frequently quoted definition was put forth by the U.N.\u2019s Brundtland Commission on sustainable development in 1987: \u201cSustainable development [meets] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d [1]",
  "Jeffrey D. Sachs, an expert on sustainable development and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, wrote: \u201cLike all living species, humanity depends on nature for food and water, materials for survival, and safety from dire environmental threats, such as epidemics and natural catastrophes. Yet for a species that depends on the beneficence of nature, or on what the scientists call \u2018environmental services,\u2019 we are doing a poor job of protecting the physical basis of our very survival!\u201d\u00a0[2]",

People from the ages of 25 to 59 whose weights fell within the listed ranges for sex (men or women), frame (small, medium, or large), and height were found to have the lowest mortality rates. These weight tables were often used to determine target weights Since then, the tables have been revised twice, changing the term \u201cideal\u201d to \u201cdesirable\u201d weight, and finally simply \u201cheight to weight\u201d tables. Though some health professionals and the general public still refer to the tables today as a guideline for optimal weight ranges, there are many criticisms about the tables such as not accounting for body composition (e.g., fat vs. muscle mass), data limited to mainly Caucasian Americans, and lack of information on causes of mortality (e.g., certain conditions like cancer that may cause a lower body weight).",

  "The number of health-related apps targeting behavior change has boomed, with more than 325,000 apps commercially available in 2017. [22] Health apps are often low-cost or free, and can be effective at-home monitoring tools that complement traditional care such as in-person visits to a doctor or dietitian.

  "This may be especially useful for certain groups; one study found that rural men were more likely to successfully use health apps for weight loss/nutrition programs than to participate in face-to-face programs, due to cultural norms of self-reliance. [23] Meta-analyses show that people who use apps can experience greater weight loss, decreased waist circumference, and lower calorie intake compared with controls, in the short-term. [24,25] Other studies have shown benefits in improving nutrition behaviors, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. [25] However, there are limitations to these meta-analyses that made comparisons difficult: the studies used different commercial apps with varying functions, and participants used the apps at varying levels (e.g., daily versus weekly). Also, most of the studies were of short duration at less than 6 months. [22,25] Generally the more often the app was used, the greater adherence there was to nutritional goals and achieving weight loss.

  "We may not appreciate body fat, especially when it accumulates in specific areas like our bellies or thighs. But fat is an important source of stored energy when we can\u2019t get to food for an extended time. Within the matrix of body fat, also called adipose tissue, there is not only fat cells but nerve and immune cells and connective tissue. [2] Fat tissue releases hormones that control metabolism and appetite (i.e., leptin, adiponectin) and that affect insulin sensitivity (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6). Macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils are some of the immune cells found in fat tissue that play a role in inflammation\u2014both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory. Fat cells also secrete proteins and build enzymes involved with immune function and the creation of steroid hormones.",
  "Fat cells can grow in size and number. The amount of fat cells in our bodies is determined soon after birth and during adolescence, and tends to be stable throughout adulthood if weight remains fairly stable. [3] But eating too many calories in the long-term can cause fat cells to increase in size and be stored in various areas throughout the body, which leads to a risk of chronic inflammation and glitches in healthy metabolism, with the potential for new fat cells to grow. These larger fat cells become resistant to insulin, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can reduce the size of fat cells but not the number.",
  "Fat tissue comes in white, brown, beige, and even pink. [2] Some are necessary for good health.",
  "Obesity, or body fatness, is calculated with various methods that range in accuracy and have limitations. Combining two or more methods, if possible, may better predict if someone has increased health risks related to weight.",
  "One of the most widely used tools for estimating excess fat is the body mass index (BMI). BMI only measures excess weight, calculating a ratio of one\u2019s weight to height. [4] However, research has shown that BMI often correlates with \u201cgold standard\u201d direct measures of fat mass and fat-free mass such as underwater weighing (hydrostatic weighing) and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). In comparison with these methods that require expensive equipment, BMI is noninvasive, easy to calculate, and can be used anywhere.",
  "Because of its simplicity and widespread use, BMI is often used when studying populations. Researchers can compare the BMI of groups of people over time in different areas, to screen for obesity and its related health risks.",
  "BMI does have several limitations. It can\u2019t measure location of fat (e.g., belly fat is linked with greater health risks), muscle mass, or bone mass\u2014all of which contribute to weight. One\u2019s age, sex, race, and ethnicity can also affect BMI. [4] For example, when comparing two people with the same BMI:",
  "BMI might be supplemented with other measures such as waist circumference or waist-hip ratio that better assess fat distribution.",
  "When examining the relationship between BMI and mortality, failure to adjust for these variables can lead to reverse causation (where a low body weight is the result of underlying illness, rather than the cause) or confounding by smoking (because smokers tend to weigh less than non-smokers and have much higher mortality rates). Experts say these methodological flaws have led to paradoxical, misleading results that suggest a survival advantage to being overweight.",
  "Some researchers consider waist circumference to be a better measure of unhealthy body fat than BMI as it addresses visceral abdominal fat, which is associated with metabolic problems, inflammation, and insulin resistance. [3,9] It is a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality, and provides a clearer picture of health, as abdominal fat can increase even if total weight remains the same. An increasing waist size can be an important \u201cwarning sign\u201d that prompts a closer look at potentially unhealthy lifestyle habits. In people who do not have overweight, increasing waist size over time may be an even more telling warning sign of increased health risks than BMI alone. [5,10]",
  "Wear thin clothing or no clothing. Stand up straight and wrap a flexible measuring tape around your midsection, laying the tape flat so it crosses your navel (belly button). The tape should be snug but not pinched too tightly around the waist. Inhale and exhale regularly, and then read the measurement (in other words, don\u2019t inhale deeply and hold your breath while measuring!). You can repeat the measurement 2-3 times to ensure a consistent reading. According to an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health, a waist size larger than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women increases the chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic diseases. [12,13]",
  "Like the waist circumference, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is used to measure abdominal obesity. It\u2019s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then dividing the waist by the hip measurement. It is inexpensive and simple to use, and a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality. Some believe that WHR may be a better indicator of risk than waist circumference alone, as waist size can vary based on body frame size, but a large study found that waist circumference and WHR were equally effective at predicting risk of death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause. [10]",
  "Still, WHR can be more complex to interpret than waist circumference, since a higher WHR reading can be caused by excess abdominal fat and/or decreased lean muscle mass around the hips. The World Health Organization has also found that cut-off points that define health risks may vary by ethnicity. For example, Asians appear to show higher metabolic risk when carrying higher body fat at a lower BMI; therefore the cut-off value for a healthy WHR in Asian women is 0.80 or less, compared with 0.85 or less in Caucasian women. [14]",
  "Stand up straight and follow the directions for measuring waist circumference. Then wrap the tape measure around the widest part of the buttocks. Divide the waist size by the hip size. The WHO defines abdominal obesity in men as a WHR more than 0.90; for women, more than 0.85. [14]",
  "To determine WHtR, divide waist circumference in inches by height in inches. A measurement of 0.5 or higher is an indicator of health risks related to visceral obesity.",
  "Although less commonly used, here are some other methods for measuring body fat.",
  "A caliper measures the thickness of a \u201cpinch\u201d of skin and the fat beneath it in specific areas of the body (torso, thighs, front and back of the upper arm, and under the shoulder blade). Equations are used to predict body fat percentage based on these measurements. It is inexpensive and convenient, but accuracy depends on the skill and training of the measurer. At least three measurements are needed from different body parts. The calipers have a limited range and therefore may not accurately measure persons with obesity or those whose skinfold thickness exceeds the width of the caliper. ",
  "BIA equipment sends a small, imperceptible, safe electric current through the body, measuring the resistance. The current faces more resistance passing through body fat than it does passing through lean body mass and water. Equations are used to estimate body fat percentage and fat-free mass. [17] The devices are convenient, portable, and relatively inexpensive but the ratio of body water to fat can change during illness, dehydration, or weight loss, decreasing its accuracy. Readings may also not be as accurate in individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher.",
  "Individuals are weighed on dry land and then again while submerged in a water tank. [17] Researchers use formulas to estimate body volume, body density, and body fat percentage. Fat \u201cfloats\u201d with more buoyancy (less density) than water, so someone with high body fat will have a lower body density than someone with low body fat and more muscle. In other words, if one\u2019s weight under water is heavier than on land due to more muscle mass and less fat, this indicates a lower body fat percentage (and visa versa). This method is accurate but costly and typically only used in a research setting. It can cause discomfort as individuals must completely submerge under water including the head, and then exhale completely before obtaining the reading.",
  "This method uses a similar principle to underwater weighing but can be done in the air instead of in water. [17] Individuals sit in a small chamber wearing a bathing suit; one commercial example is the \u201cBod Pod.\u201d The machine estimates body volume based on air pressure differences between the empty chamber and the occupied chamber. It is expensive but accurate, quick, and comfortable for those who prefer not to be submerged in water.",
  "Individuals drink isotope-labeled water and give body fluid samples. Researchers analyze these samples for isotope levels, which are then used to calculate total body water, fat-free body mass, and in turn, body fat mass. [17] It is accurate, not as costly, and can be used in individuals with a BMI of 40 or higher, but accuracy can be decreased by illness, dehydration, or weight loss.",
  "X-ray beams pass through different body tissues at different rates. DEXA uses two low-level X-ray beams to develop estimates of fat-free mass, fat mass, and bone mineral density. [17] DEXA is accurate but uses heavy expensive equipment so is typically only used in research settings. It cannot distinguish between subcutaneous and visceral fat, cannot be used in persons sensitive to radiation (e.g., pregnant women, children), and cannot accommodate persons with a BMI of 35 or higher.",
  "These two imaging techniques are now considered to be the most accurate methods for measuring tissue, organ, and whole-body fat mass as well as lean muscle mass and bone mass. [17] It can measure specific body fat compartments, such as abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat. However, CT and MRI scans are typically used only in research settings because the equipment is extremely expensive and cannot be moved. CT scans cannot be used with pregnant women or children, due to exposure to ionizing radiation, and certain MRI and CT scanners may not be able to accommodate individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher.",
  "Some studies suggest that the connection between body mass index and premature death follows a U-shaped curve. This means that weighing too much\u2014or too little\u2014isn\u2019t as healthy as weighing somewhere in the middle. The problem is that most of these studies included smokers and individuals with early, but undetected, chronic and fatal diseases. Cigarette smokers as a group weigh less than nonsmokers, in part because smoking deadens the appetite. Potentially deadly chronic diseases such as cancer, emphysema, kidney failure, and heart failure can cause weight loss even before they cause symptoms and have been diagnosed. So low weights don\u2019t necessarily cause early death. Instead, low weight is often the result of illnesses or habits that may be fatal.",
  "Many epidemiologic studies confirm that increasing weight is associated with increasing disease risk. The American Cancer Society fielded two large long-term Cancer Prevention Studies that \u00a0included more than one million adults who were followed for at least 12 years. [18,19] They excluded people who smoked and others who could experience secondary weight loss from an illness such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, or who developed a chronic disease in the first few years of follow-up. Both studies showed a clear pattern of increasing mortality with increasing weight. The data confirmed similar observations from a 27-year follow-up of more than 19,000 middle-aged men in the Harvard Alumni Health Study, [20] a 16-year follow-up of more than 115,000 middle-aged women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, [21] a 12-year follow-up of nonsmoking Seventh-day Adventists, [22] and a 10-year follow-up of more than 500,000 middle-aged men and women in the National Institutes of Health/AARP study. [23] Another analysis of the Cancer Prevention Study cohort found that increased weight was tied to increased mortality from all cancers and specific cancers; [24] in fact, study investigators estimated that overweight and obesity is responsible for 14% of all cancer deaths in women and 20% of all cancer deaths in men.",

It is based on observations like higher heart rate, heavier and faster breathing, increased sweating, and muscles feeling tired. It does not use actual measurements of these occurrences but a personal self-check.",
  "The scale uses numbers from 6 to 20. The lowest rating is \u201cno feeling of exertion,\u201d at number 6, and the highest rating is \u201cvery, very hard,\u201d at number 20. Moderate activities register 11 to 14 (\u201cfairly light\u201d to \u201csomewhat hard\u201d) while vigorous activities usually rate 15 or higher (\u201chard\u201d to \u201cvery, very hard\u201d). Dr. Gunnar Borg, who created the scale, set it to run from 6 to 20 as a simple way to estimate heart rate\u2014multiplying the Borg score by 10 gives an approximate heart rate for a particular level of activity. [1]",
  "Exercise workouts may vary in intensity throughout the session. You can use the Borg Scale to change the intensity, by speeding up or slowing down movements or applying more or less resistance (such as increasing the incline on a treadmill or turning the resistance\u00a0control knob on a stationary bicycle).",

  "MET stands for the metabolic equivalent of task. One MET is the amount of energy used while sitting quietly. Physical activities may be rated using METs to indicate their intensity. For example, reading may use about 1.3 METs while running may use 8-9 METs. METs can also be translated into light, moderate, and vigorous intensities of exercise.",
  "Moderate-intensity activities are those that get you moving fast enough or strenuously enough to burn off three to six times as much energy per minute as you do when you are sitting quietly, or exercises that clock in at 3 to 6 METs. Vigorous-intensity activities burn more than 6 METs.",

Thus, walking at 3 to 4 miles-per-hour is considered to require 4 METs and to be a moderate-intensity activity, regardless of who is doing the activity\u2014a young marathon runner or a 90-year-old grandmother.

Studies looking at the accuracy of devices in tracking calories used while exercising tend to be small in size. In one study, 14 participants wearing different popular brand devices walked and ran. The estimated calorie usage displayed on the devices was compared with measurements from indirect calorimetry (a reliably accurate technique to measure calorie output). The results were mixed. Some of the devices were accurate for calorie expenditure with running but not walking and visa versa. Some of the devices overestimated the amount of calories used during exercise. [5] Other studies found similar discrepancies. [6]",
  "Tracking devices can be useful for personal motivation and accountability, but the data should be interpreted with caution as there are variable readings among devices. The accuracy of the data may also vary within the same device when performing different intensities of exercise. [6] They are best used with other methods to gauge fitness levels, such as monitoring the frequency, duration, and perceived exertion of your exercise routine. It\u2019s also important to have motivation to exercise because you enjoy how you feel during and after the exercise, not just to reach a certain number on a tracker.",
  "Safety should be a major priority when exercising. Any physical activity carries the risk of injury, whether you are just starting an exercise regimen or are a seasoned fitness buff.

  "Our bodies react to all types of stress via the same mechanism, which occurs regardless if the stress arises from a real or perceived event. Both acute and chronic stressors cause the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response. Hormones are released that instigate several actions within seconds: pumping blood and oxygen quickly to our cells, quickening the heart rate, and increasing mental alertness. In prehistoric times, this rapid response was needed to quickly escape a dangerous situation or fight off a predator. However all types of stress can trigger this response, as described in more detail below:",
  "With acute stress, the event is brief and hormone levels will gradually return to normal. Acute episodic and chronic stress repeatedly trigger the fight-or-flight response causing a persistent elevation of hormones, leading to a risk of health problems: [2]",
  "Chronic stress can affect the body\u2019s use of calories and nutrients in various ways. It raises the body\u2019s metabolic needs and increases the use and excretion of many nutrients.

  "Sleep is as essential to our daily needs as food and water. Although we may feel that sleep simply rests our tired bodies, our brain remains active throughout the night. Sleep plays a critical role in brain as well as physical functioning.",
  "Our internal body clock, called a circadian clock, tells us when we are ready to sleep. There are actually several circadian clocks in the body, found in the brain and other organs. They are triggered by cues such as daylight (we feel alert) and darkness (we feel drowsy). These clocks can also be triggered by artificial bright light or stimulants like caffeine and alcohol that cause us to feel awake even if it is nighttime.",
  "There are several phases of sleep our body experiences. They are classified as REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. We cycle repeatedly through these phases about 4-6 times throughout the night, and it is not uncommon to wake up briefly between cycles.",
  "During REM, your pupils twitch and move quickly from side to side underneath closed eyelids. Brain activity rises as you breathe faster and your heart rate increases. It is the phase of sleep when dreams are most common, and certain nerves signal your limbs to become temporarily paralyzed so you do not act out the dream. REM tends to occur later at night and into early morning. Memory is processed and stored during REM sleep.",
  "There are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. [1] Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness.",
  "About one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [2,3] Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. Because of the public health burden of poor sleep health, achieving sufficient sleep in children and adults was included as a goal in the Healthy People 2020 goals. [4]",
  "Sleep helps to process your thoughts from the day as well as store memories, so a lack of good-quality sleep can lead to difficulty focusing and thinking clearly. You may feel tired, irritable, or anxious during the day. Performance at work or school may suffer. Your reaction time may be slowed, increasing the risk of driving accidents.",
  "In children, insufficient sleep can lead to attention and behavior problems or hyperactivity. In the elderly, lack of sleep may decrease focus and attention, leading to a greater risk of falls, bone fractures, and car accidents.",
  "If you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death.",
  "Other effects of poor sleep include increased fat storage in the belly area, higher body mass index, poorer quality diet, and decreased insulin sensitivity. [6,10] Interestingly, some studies have also shown that longer sleep times (more than 9 hours) are also associated with developing belly fat compared with sleeping 7-8 hours a night. [7]",
  "Some people who have insufficient sleep have a condition called obstructive sleep apnea, which blocks breathing in the upper airway tubes, often because of increased fat in the tongue. Sleep apnea is independently associated with insulin resistance; a lack of oxygen while sleeping can cause oxidative stress and inflammation that are believed to progress toward insulin resistance. [11]",
  "Poor sleep and insomnia (an inability to sleep or stay asleep) are associated with depression, especially if the insomnia becomes chronic. [20] Insomnia is also associated with increased likelihood of insomnia relapsing over time. Poor sleep quality can impair functioning, increase fatigue, and lead to mood changes. The reverse is also true in which depressive symptoms of intense sadness or hopelessness can interrupt sleep. Insomnia as well as oversleeping are common signs of clinical depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. [21] Treating the depression may lead to improvements in sleep quality. If there is an underlying medical disorder causing the insomnia such as obstructive sleep apnea or chronic pain, then treatment should address these first.",
  "In 2021, authors of a cohort study sought to tease out the association of early brain changes and sleep changes by including younger patients 50 years of age. They followed 7,959 participants for up to 25 years and found that participants who were between the ages of 50-70 years and slept 6 hours or less a night showed a 30% higher risk of developing dementia in later life, compared with those who slept 7 hours. [40] The association was only slightly weaker when authors controlled for various factors independently associated with dementia like cardiometabolic status (high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, cardiovascular disease), sociodemographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status), health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, exercise, intake of fruits and vegetables), and mental health factors (depression). The authors did not find an association with longer sleep durations (8 or more hours) and dementia, though this may have been due to the low number of participants who slept longer durations.",
  "Epidemiological studies show that insufficient sleep is independently associated with a higher risk of obesity. Clinical studies of of sleep-restricted adults show an increased hunger and calorie intake when participants are allowed free access to food. [7] A preference for late evening or nighttime food intake and increased snacking has been observed. [9] There also appears to be a food preference for higher carbohydrate and fat foods, which could partly explain the overall higher calorie intake.",
  "Changes in hormone levels that signal either hunger or satiety have also been observed in clinical sleep restriction studies. Leptin is a hormone associated with satisfaction. When food enters the stomach, leptin is released from fat cells and travels to the brain where it signals the body to stop eating by creating a sensation of fullness. People with obesity may actually have very high levels of leptin; the more body fat one has, the more leptin is produced in fat cells. However, a condition called leptin resistance may occur in which the brain does not receive the usual signal from leptin to stop eating. In response, more and more leptin is released. Lower leptin levels as well as high leptin levels suggesting leptin resistance have been observed in sleep-deprived adults. [7]",
  "Ghrelin, the \u201chunger hormone,\u201d typically has the opposing action of leptin. It is released in the gut and sends hunger signals to the brain when someone is not eating enough. About three hours after eating a meal, ghrelin levels drop. Clinical studies have found that sleep restriction leads to elevated ghrelin levels. [9]",
  "Despite this interesting theory of poor sleep leading to changes in appetite hormone levels, other studies have found no changes and therefore the association is still inconclusive. [9] Conflicting findings may be due to differences in the study participants (e.g., age, gender) and differences in how the researchers defined the duration and severity of sleep restriction.",
  "Sleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps. Toddlers need about 10-14 hours a day. Preteens and teenagers need about 8-12 hours a night, and adults about 7-8 hours a day. [30] A consensus by the AASM and Sleep Research Society recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours a night to promote optimal health. [31]",
  "Other factors such as quality of sleep are important, because just meeting the total recommended sleep hours may not be enough if one wakes up frequently in the night. A common belief is that lost sleep from a late night out or studying can be recovered by \u201csleeping in\u201d another day or taking naps. However, both of these methods disrupt the body\u2019s circadian rhythms and may deprive the body of deeper sleep stages. In fact, increased variability in how much sleep we get from night to night is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic and heart diseases. [32] It is important to respond, whenever possible, to the body\u2019s natural signals of sleepiness.",
  "Two popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids. Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality, but can cause daytime drowsiness. It is well tolerated in adults with few reported adverse events in doses up to 10 mg. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the judicious use of melatonin for certain sleep and circadian disorders such as shift work disorder or jet lag. [33]",
  "Valerian contains small amounts of GABA, a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, and some studies have shown that valerian can improve sleep. However, other studies have found no difference in sleep when taking valerian compared with placebo, and there appears to be minimal benefit in those who have diagnosed insomnia. The AASM does not recommend valerian for insomnia disorder. [33]",
  "It is important to note that supplements are not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety or effectiveness. Therefore doses and preparations of these herbs can vary widely. A study of 31 melatonin products found that the melatonin levels in the pills ranged between 83%-478% of the dose reported on the label. [33] More than 70% of the products varied from the labeled dose by more than 10%. If supplements are used, look for a label verifying its quality from a third-party, such as from the U.S. Pharmacopeia.",
  "Randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for sleep such as minimizing napping during the day, relaxation training, breathing exercises, and sleep hygiene are highly effective and recommended as first-line treatments for insomnia. [35,33] They have been found more effective than medications for the long-term management of insomnia. People may be asked to keep a sleep journal to record sleep habits and activities performed around bedtime, which can help determine the most appropriate CBT.",

Compared with those who did not incorporate any of these lifestyle factors, those with all five factors lived up to 14 years longer.",
  "Beyond the five core lifestyle habits mentioned above, a growing body of research is identifying additional factors that may be key to increasing our healthspans:",
  "Food aromas are important as they trigger the release of saliva, stomach acid, and enzymes in preparation for digestion. [23] The scent of food can trigger the release of dopamine and serotonin, causing a feeling of wellbeing to encourage eating. An impaired sense of smell in older adults is also associated with less variety in food choices and poorer nutrition, but can also lead to increased food intake and weight gain in some individuals. [23]",
  "Eating and food preparation are also important activities offering socialization and mental stimulation such as when learning new cooking skills. Preparing meals helps to reduce sedentariness as there are several action steps involved: selecting and purchasing, washing and chopping, and cooking the ingredients.",
  "Identifying additional factors that improve and extend our healthspans is an active area of scientific inquiry. In the meantime, current research findings are encouraging, and underscore the importance of following healthy lifestyle habits throughout one\u2019s life course. That said, sticking to these behaviors is easier said than done, and public policies must support and promote these habits by improving the food and physical environments that surround us.",

  "A healthy amount of body fat in children and teens varies based on age as well as sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed growth charts for boys and girls ages 2-19 that show the distribution of BMI values at each age. [3] By the CDC\u2019s definition, a child whose BMI falls between the 85th and 94th percentile for age and sex is considered overweight; a BMI at the 95th percentile or higher for age is considered obese. As the rates of obesity rise in children, there is also a category for severe obesity in which the BMI is 120% of the 95th percentile. The American Academy of Pediatrics provides more specific classifications of severe obesity:",
  "Obesity can negatively affect nearly every system in a child\u2019s body \u2013 the heart, lungs, muscles, bones, kidneys, digestive tract, and hormones that control blood sugar and puberty \u2013 and can also take a heavy social and emotional toll. Children with obesity may be burdened by stigma and discrimination from bullying, teasing and victimization. Youth with obesity have substantially higher odds of remaining overweight or obese into adulthood increasing their risk of disease and disability later in life. [4]",
  "The risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, and other weight-related health risks increases with an increasing body mass index (BMI). But evidence shows that in some ethnic and racial groups, weight gain and higher fat mass even if BMI remains in the normal range can still increase health risks. The Nurses\u2019 Health Study tracked patterns of weight gain and type 2 diabetes (T2D) development in 78,000 U.S. women to see differences by ethnic group. [5] All women were healthy at the start of the study. After 20 years, researchers found that at the same BMI, Asians had more than twice the risk of developing T2D than Whites; Hispanics and Blacks also had higher risks of diabetes than Whites, but to a lesser degree. Increases in weight over time were more harmful in Asians than in other ethnic groups \u2013 for every 11 pounds Asians gained during adulthood, they had an 84% increased risk of T2D; Hispanics, Blacks, and Whites who gained weight also had higher risk, but to a much lesser degree than Asians. Other studies have found that even with a lower BMI than Whites, increasing weight in Asians with a BMI of 25 or higher increased risk of high blood pressure, T2D, and early death from all causes. [6-8] One reason for this difference could be amount and location of body fat. Even with a lower BMI than other populations, Chinese and South Asians tend to carry higher abdominal fat than Whites, which increases the risk for T2D, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic disorders. [9-11] In contrast, some studies have found that blacks have lower body fat and higher lean muscle mass than whites at the same BMI, and therefore at the same BMI, may be at lower risk of obesity-related diseases. [12,13] For this reason, the World Health Organization and other organizations have recommended a lower BMI cutoff to classify obesity in Asian people (BMI of 25-27 or greater) as well as a smaller waist circumference to measure visceral fat. [9,14]",
  "Weight gain of greater than 10 pounds in adulthood also increases disease risk (i.e., heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones) even in those whose BMI remains in the normal range, according to research from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.

  "Obesity costs the U.S. health care system almost $173 billion annually. [2] This includes money spent directly on medical care and prescription drugs related to obesity. In the workplace, research has shown that the number of sick days, short-term disability, and workers\u2019 compensation days increase with increasing BMI. [21] Compared with an employee with a BMI of 25, an employee with a BMI of 35 has nearly double the risk of a disability or workers\u2019 compensation claim. Perhaps one of the most surprising consequences of the current obesity epidemic in the U.S. is its impact on recruitment for the armed services, with data showing that 3 in 5 young adults carry too much weight to qualify for military service.

  "The U.S. has among the highest childhood obesity rates in the world, with nearly 1 in 3 children with overweight or obesity. In 2015-2016, nearly 19% of children 2-19 years old had obesity, affecting an estimated 14 million children nationwide. Obesity prevalence was highest among adolescents 12-19 years old (21%) and lowest among preschool-aged children 2-5 years old (14%). [27] Recently, the prevalence of obesity declined among children ages 2-5 years old, held steady for children 6-11 years, and continued to rise among adolescents 12-19 years. [28,29] Current trends suggest that an alarming 57% of children currently between 2 and 19 years old will have obesity at age 35. [30] Overweight and obesity disproportionally affects racial/ethnic minority populations, and such disparities exist as early as age 2 and persist into adulthood. [27,30] The highest obesity prevalence are among Hispanic (26%) and non-Hispanic Black children (22%), compared with the lowest prevalence among non-Hispanic White (14%) and non-Hispanic Asian (11%) children. [27] Canada has also seen a rise in childhood obesity since the late 1970s. Obesity rates have more than doubled, and in some age groups, tripled. [31] But childhood obesity rates are lower there than they are in the U.S; in 2013, 10% of children ages 6-11 years old and 17% of children ages 12-17 had obesity.

  "Over the past several decades, obesity has become a significant health challenge in Latin America.\u00a0While undernourishment persists among vulnerable groups, so do overweight and obesity.\u00a0Each year, obesity among the population grows by 3.6 million individuals, and now exceeds undernourishment as the greatest nutritional threat. [34] Between 1975 and 2014, among the largest increases in BMI in regions worldwide occurred for men in central Latin America, and for women in Andean Latin America and the Caribbean. [35] In 2016, approximately 104 million adults in Latin America had obesity; 15% of men and 16% of women. [23] Countries with the highest prevalence of obesity included Bermuda (women 43%, men 30%) and Puerto Rico (women 42%, men 29%). [23]",
  "While Latin America has shown significant progress in reducing child stunting due to undernourishment, prevalence of overweight and obesity due to malnutrition has grown to be among the highest in the world. [34] As a result, Latin American children have the dual burden of undernutrition coexisting with overweight and obesity. [36] In 2016, 15% of children ages 5-9 years and 10% of adolescents ages 10-19 years had obesity in Latin America and the Caribbean. [34]\u00a0Among girls ages 5-19 years old, central Latin America demonstrated the highest increase of BMI per decade worldwide over the past 40 years.

Some have called it a \u201csilent epidemic,\u201d striking countries that are still struggling with the health and economic burdens of malnutrition, stunting, infectious disease, and high childhood mortality rates. [40] Obesity prevalence is higher among African women compared with men, and can vary widely from country to country.\u00a0For example in 2016, 41% of women in South Africa had obesity (higher than in U.S. women) compared with 16% of men. In stark contrast, the lowest prevalence of obesity was in Ethiopia for women (7.3%) and in Uganda for men (2%); prevalence of undernutrition exceeds that of overnutrition in these African countries among many others.

  "In fact, researchers examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on mortality during a decades-long perspective study of over 100,000 women found that approximately 64% of deaths among current smokers and 28% of deaths among former smokers were attributable to cigarette smoking. [2]",
  "In a study of over one million women, body-mass index (BMI) was a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease. The incidence of coronary heart disease increases progressively with BMI. [7]",
  "In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer.",
  "You can help prevent heart disease by doing five key things and making them into habits:",
  "Strong studies make it possible to link reductions in risk to these habits. Following a healthy lifestyle may prevent over 80% of cases of coronary artery disease, [24, 25] 50% of ischemic strokes, [26] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [27] and 72% of premature deaths related to heart disease. [28] In other words, a healthy lifestyle is a good investment in a longer, healthier life.",

  "Our cells depend on a single simple sugar, glucose, for most of their energy needs. The body has intricate mechanisms in place to make sure glucose levels in the blood don\u2019t go too low or soar too high. When you eat, most digestible carbohydrates are converted into glucose and quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. Any rise in blood sugar signals the pancreas to make and release the hormone insulin, which instructs cells to sponge up glucose. Without insulin, glucose floats around the bloodstream, unable to slip inside the cells that need it for energy.",
  "Diabetes mellitus is a condition of abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood because either the body is not making enough insulin or can\u2019t properly use the insulin it makes. Normally, blood glucose rises after eating a meal but then drops in 1-2 hours as the glucose is shuttled out of the blood and into cells. In people with diabetes, their blood glucose may remain elevated for several hours. Their blood glucose may also rise much higher after eating a meal than someone who does not have diabetes.",
  "There is much attention on high blood sugar or hyperglycemia, which occurs with all forms of diabetes. But there also exists a condition of too low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can occur from not eating enough food, waiting too long to eat a meal or snack, eating an imbalanced diet that does not contain enough carbohydrate, or exercising more intensely than usual. Sometimes eating too many refined carbohydrates (white bread and pasta, cookies, soda) without also including other foods like protein and vegetables can lead to hypoglycemia because this can quickly spike blood sugar; in response the pancreas may produce too much insulin to help lower the blood sugar quickly, causing a \u201csugar crash.\u201d If a person is taking insulin or using certain oral medications that cause the body to secrete more insulin, they are at higher risk of experiencing hypoglycemia if they are not eating at consistent meal times or an adequate amount of carbohydrate.",
  "Hypoglycemia is diagnosed with a blood sugar level of 70 mg/dL or less. Mild to moderate symptoms include shaking, sweating, dizziness, irregular heart rates, irritability, and confusion. These symptoms are usually corrected by taking a small portion of quick-digesting carbohydrate such as 4 ounces of juice or soda, glucose tablets, or a tablespoon of sugar or honey.",
  "Severe symptoms are rare and typically occur only in people with type 1 diabetes who are using insulin. These include seizures, unconsciousness, or such disorientation that the person is unable to eat, drink, or call for help. Anyone with type 1 diabetes should wear a medical alert bracelet indicating that they have diabetes. They may also wish to keep a glucagon emergency kit nearby and teach family members, friends, and coworkers how to give a glucagon injection, which will quickly raise their blood sugar. ",
  "There are different types of diabetes, including prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The most common types in the U.S. are prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, which are largely influenced by carrying excess body fat, a poor diet, and lack of exercise.",
  "Almost 30 million Americans have diabetes; of those, about 7 million don\u2019t know they have the disease. [1] About 84 million adults have a condition called prediabetes that is a precursor to full-blown diabetes. In 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed cases of diabetes in the U.S. was $327 billion including direct medical costs and reduced productivity. (1) If the spread of type 2 diabetes continues at its present rate, the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in the United States will increase to about 48 million in 2050. [2] Worldwide, the number of adults with diabetes will rise to 439 million in the year 2030. [3]",
  "Secondary health problems stemming from diabetes are equally alarming. High blood glucose levels can damage organs and tissues. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and kidney failure among adults. It causes mild to severe nerve damage that, coupled with diabetes-related circulation problems, often leads to the loss of a leg or foot. Diabetes significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attacks and strokes. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., directly causing almost 80,000 deaths each year and contributing to thousands more. [1,4,5]",
  "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes) is an autoimmune condition in which immune cells attack and permanently disable the insulin-making cells in the pancreas. It has also been called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes because it was once believed that only children developed this form and that insulin was only used for type 1 diabetes. These terms are now inaccurate because it is possible for older adults to develop type 1 diabetes (called type 1 diabetes onset in adults), and people with later stages of type 2 diabetes sometimes require insulin.",
  "Insulin is a hormone that shuttles glucose out of the bloodstream and into cells to be used for energy. If the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, blood glucose levels may continue to rise to a dangerous level. This is why people with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin.",
  "There are numerous study groups actively researching the prevention of type 1 diabetes. One of the largest is the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group, an international network of physicians and scientists working in 25 clinical centers who are researching ways to prevent, delay, and reverse the progression of type 1 diabetes by preserving insulin production before and after diagnosis.",
  "Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a subtype of type 1 diabetes. It has been called \u201ctype 1.5 diabetes\u201d because it is an autoimmune form like type 1 diabetes but develops more slowly like type 2 diabetes. [9] With both type 1 diabetes and LADA, the cells of the pancreas that make insulin stop working. But LADA progresses more slowly than type 1 diabetes so that insulin medication may not be needed for up to several years after being diagnosed. If a person with LADA is still making some insulin, healthy lifestyle changes might delay its progression. However, if the disease progresses so that they produce less or no insulin, they will likely require insulin medication.",
  "Because people with LADA are often able to produce some insulin at younger ages, they are typically not diagnosed until an adult, usually after age 30. However, because of their older age at diagnosis, they may be misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes (even though they do not have insulin resistance, and may be at a normal weight, eat a healthful diet, and exercise, which is not typical for an individual who has type 2 diabetes).",
  "LADA is diagnosed by the presence of antibodies, diabetes diagnosis at a later age, no family history of type 2 diabetes, and a progressive increase in insulin needs. If someone diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is having increasing difficulty controlling the diabetes with oral medications and healthy lifestyle changes alone, he or she may wish to be screened for LADA.",
  "In many cases, gestational diabetes resolves after the baby is born, although the mother is at 67% higher risk of developing it again in future pregnancies. She is also at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in the future. Gestational diabetes is believed to be caused by the development of insulin resistance, in which the mother produces insulin but the hormone does not work properly. It is unclear why some pregnant women develop insulin resistance and others do not, but being overweight or obese prior to pregnancy increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes.",
  "The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says that losing extra weight and increasing physical activity before becoming pregnant can lower the risk of developing gestational diabetes. These lifestyle changes can improve how the body uses insulin and help blood glucose levels to stay normal. A Cochrane review looking at lifestyle changes during pregnancy found moderate evidence that both healthy diet and exercise reduced the risk of gestational diabetes and caesarean section when compared with standard care (no special exercise or diet). [10]",
  "It is important to control blood glucose levels during pregnancy, because any extra glucose travels through the placenta to the baby. The baby\u2019s body may then produce extra insulin in response to the excess glucose. If the baby does not need the extra glucose for energy, it will be stored as fat, which is why babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes tend to be larger than average. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes have a higher chance of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.",
  "Prediabetes is an early warning sign that exhibits itself through moderately elevated blood sugar levels, sometimes called \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance.\u201d Prediabetes almost always precedes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes usually do not have any symptoms, so the condition is only discovered if their doctors check their blood glucose. Prediabetes is diagnosed if one\u2019s blood glucose reading is 100-125 mg/dL after fasting for at least 8 hours (normal range is less than 100). More than one-third of the U.S. population, or 84 million people, has prediabetes. [4,5]",
  "\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes) is the most common form of diabetes. It begins when muscles and other cells stop responding to insulin\u2019s open-up-for-glucose signal. The body responds by making more and more insulin to help move glucose out of the blood, but eventually exhausting the insulin-producing cells until they burn out. Although genetic mutations may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, environmental factors are a more likely contributor to the insulin not working properly. These factors include excessive weight gain, a diet high in refined carbohydrate and saturated fats, and a sedentary lifestyle. It is also unclear if a family history of type 2 diabetes caused by genetic mutations contributes to future generations developing the disease, or if it is more a matter of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors passed down to children.",
  "Symptoms of long-term poorly controlled blood glucose or undiagnosed diabetes include frequent urination (excess sugar passes through the kidneys, which creates more urine to remove it from the body), increased thirst, and unintentional weight loss as the glucose from food passes out of the body unabsorbed. Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed if one\u2019s blood glucose reading is 126 mg/dL or higher after fasting for at least 8 hours.",
  "Type 2 diabetes, once called adult-onset diabetes, is striking an ever-growing number of adults. Even more alarming, it is now showing up in teenagers and children. With the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups.",
  "Although the genes you inherit may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, they take a back seat to behavioral and lifestyle factors. Data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study suggest that 90% of type 2 diabetes in women can be attributed to five such factors: excess weight, lack of exercise, a less-than-healthy diet, smoking, and abstaining from alcohol. [13]",
  "Information from several clinical trials strongly supports the idea that type 2 diabetes is preventable.",
  "However, if these types of diabetes are not diagnosed early or are not well-controlled for a long period, the cells of the pancreas can become permanently damaged so that they no longer produce insulin. If this happens, chances are higher that diet and exercise alone may no longer be effective in controlling the diabetes and lifelong medication may be needed. The same is true with type 1 diabetes and LADA, in which the pancreas already does not make enough insulin. With these conditions, the diabetes can be managed but not reversed.",
  "The good news is that type 2 diabetes (as well as prediabetes) are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the U.S. can be avoided by healthy lifestyle practices, including controlling your weight, following a healthy diet, staying active, and not smoking.",
  "The more veggies \u2014 and the greater the variety \u2014 the better. Potatoes and French fries don\u2019t count.",
  "Keeping weight in check, being active, and eating a healthy diet can help prevent most cases of type 2 diabetes.",
  "Excess weight is the single most important cause of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes seven-fold. Being obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes than someone with a healthy weight. [1]",
  "Losing weight can help if your weight is above the healthy-weight range. Losing 7-10% of your current weight can cut your chances of developing type 2 diabetes in half.",
  "Inactivity promotes type 2 diabetes. [2] Working your muscles more often and making them work harder improves their ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. This puts less stress on your insulin-making cells. So trade some of your sit-time for fit-time.",
  "Long bouts of hot, sweaty exercise aren\u2019t necessary to reap this benefit. Findings from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study suggest that walking briskly for a half hour every day reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30%. [3,4] More recently, The Black Women\u2019s Health Study reported similar diabetes-prevention benefits for brisk walking of more than 5 hours per week. [5] This amount of exercise has a variety of other benefits as well. And even greater cardiovascular and other advantages can be attained by more, and more intense, exercise.",
  "Television-watching appears to be an especially-detrimental form of inactivity: Every two hours you spend watching TV instead of pursuing something more active increases the chances of developing diabetes by 20%; it also increases the risk of heart disease (15%) and early death (13%). [6] The more television people watch, the more likely they are to be overweight or obese, and this seems to explain part of the TV viewing-diabetes link. The unhealthy diet patterns associated with TV watching may also explain some of this relationship.",
  "Four dietary changes can have a big impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes.",
  "Whole grains don\u2019t contain a magical nutrient that fights diabetes and improves health. It\u2019s the entire package\u2014elements intact and working together\u2014that\u2019s important. The bran and fiber in whole grains make it more difficult for digestive enzymes to break down the starches into glucose. This leads to lower, slower increases in blood sugar and insulin, and a lower glycemic index. As a result, they stress the body\u2019s insulin-making machinery less, and so may help prevent type 2 diabetes. [9] Whole grains are also rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that may help reduce the risk of diabetes.",
  "Why do these types of meat appear to boost diabetes risk? It may be that the high iron content of red meat diminishes insulin\u2019s effectiveness or damages the cells that produce insulin. The high levels of sodium and nitrites (preservatives) in processed red meats may also be to blame. Red and processed meats are a hallmark of the unhealthful \u201cWestern\u201d dietary pattern, which seems to trigger diabetes in people who are already at genetic risk. [32]",
  "Furthermore, a related body of research has suggested that plant-based dietary patterns\u00a0may help lower type 2 diabetes risk, and more specifically, those who adhere to predominantly healthy plant-based diets may have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who follow these diets with lower adherence:",
  "Add type 2 diabetes to the long list of health problems linked with smoking. Smokers are roughly 50% more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers, and heavy smokers have an even higher risk. [33]",
  "The more veggies \u2014 and the greater the variety \u2014 the better. Potatoes and French fries don\u2019t count.",
  "Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells divide and grow out of control, destroying healthy surrounding tissue. Normal healthy cells in the body follow certain rules, growing and dividing in an orderly fashion. Eventually they die and are replaced with new cells. But sometimes old or damaged cells do not die and form an abnormal mass of tissue called a tumor. Tumors may be benign, meaning that they do not invade nearby healthy tissue. But sometimes they are malignant, in which genes in the cells deviate, causing them to grow and divide erratically and spread into nearby tissues. As cancer cells continue to grow, they may break off from the original growth and travel through the blood or lymph fluid to other parts of the body. Genetic changes can be inherited, or the result of DNA damage caused by external exposures like excessive ultraviolet light or carcinogens like tobacco smoke.",
  "The global burden of cancer is rising alongside the world\u2019s aging population: 1 in 5 men and 1 in 6 women worldwide develop some type of cancer during their lifetime, and 1 in 8 men and 1 in 11 women die from the disease. [1] Cancer also takes a huge economic toll. A report from the World Economic Forum and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health projected that the global cost of cancer, including medical costs, non-medical costs, and income losses, will total an estimated U.S. $458 billion in 2030. [2]",
  "Cancer is not just one disease. There are more than 100 types, which can start anywhere in the body. They are named by the organ or tissue in which they start growing. They can form in organs, bones, muscles, tendons, fat, blood vessels, and lymph fluid. Examples of more common types include:",
  "Beyond the classification of cancer by site, tumors originating from the same tissue can have different features\u2014a distinction which can help decide the most effective treatment. For example:",
  "However, cancer cells also have in common a range of abnormal features. [4] They ignore signals to stop dividing, quickly replicate, escape detection by the body\u2019s immune cells, and invade normal tissues. Cancer cells cause nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply the tumor with oxygen and nutrients, which is needed to grow.",
  "All cells are exposed to genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they have mechanisms to repair damage to genes and protect themselves against these hallmarks of cancer. [5] However, due to factors like aging, the environment (e.g., UV radiation), and lifestyle (e.g., poor diet, smoking), the protective mechanisms sometimes fail, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.",
  "Cancer screening tests look for evidence of cancer cells or abnormal cells that may become cancer in people who do not show any symptoms. This helps to catch and remove a pre-cancer lesion and avert the cancer, or treat a potential cancer early, before it grows or spreads and causes symptoms, and which may be easier to treat. Examples of screening tests that lower the risk of dying early from cancer include:",
  "However, there are sometimes downsides to screening. Individuals should discuss the pros and cons of screening tests with their doctor.",
  "Vaccinations can prevent a few types of cancer caused by prolonged infection from specific pathogens. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for females ages 9 to 26 years old and males 9 to 21 years old. It protects against the HPV types that most often cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers. [7] The hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes hepatitis B, a serious chronic illness that can lead to liver cancer. [8] Vaccines targeting other cancer-causing viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus) are under development, but it is emphasized that vaccination should not be a substitute for routine screening according to recommended guidelines. [9,10]",
  "According to the World Health Organization, a 30-40% cancer burden can be attributed to lifestyle risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. [6] That\u2019s why a lifestyle consisting of a healthy dietary pattern, weight management, and physical activity may help reduce the risk of cancer.",
  "The more veggies \u2014 and the greater the variety \u2014 the better. Potatoes and French fries don\u2019t count.",
  "Because each person is exposed to unique environmental and lifestyle factors, cancer risk can vary. Although some factors cannot be controlled (such as inherited genetic mutations), there is a range of modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors that can help reduce the risk of developing cancer.",
  "In a meta-analysis conducted by the WCRF/AICR, there is convincing evidence that carrying extra fat mass, marked by a higher body mass index (BMI), greater waist circumference, and greater waist-to-hip ratio, significantly increases the risk of several cancers: [4]",
  "Significant increasing weight in adult life is a convincing cause of\u00a0postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer.",
  "There is evidence from a 2009\u00a0meta-analysis\u00a0of 52\u00a0epidemiologic studies showing that the most physically active individuals had a 24% lower risk of colon cancer than those who were the least physically active. [6] A 2013 meta-analysis of 31 prospective studies showed that the average breast cancer risk reduction associated with physical activity was 12%, and the protective effect was stronger for postmenopausal women. [7] After menopause, women who increase their physical activity may also have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who do not. [8]",
  "Sedentary behaviors, such as spending an extended amount of time sitting, reclining, or lying down, may also increase cancer risk. [9] The review of research on sedentary behavior and risk of endometrial, colon, and lung cancers found that the highest versus lowest levels of sedentary time increased risks of these cancers by a statistically significant range of 20-35%. [10]",
  "The recommendations also emphasize that not smoking and avoiding other exposure to tobacco and excess sun are also important in reducing cancer risk.",
  "Although evidence is not strong enough to reach firm conclusions, there are indications of links between lifestyle factors and cancer survivorship with improved quality of life and longer survival, especially for more common cancers. For example, maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, eating foods containing fiber, and having a lower intake of saturated fat appear to lead to better survival after a breast cancer diagnosis.[14] Unless otherwise advised, and if they can, all cancer patients and survivors are advised to follow the WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations as long as possible after the acute stage of treatment.",

  "\u201cThere is no health without oral health.\u201d You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.",
  "Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]",
  "The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.",
  "Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.",
  "Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person\u2019s intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.",
  "Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body\u2019s process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body\u2019s immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]",
  "Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.",
  "If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]",
  "Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:",
  "Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.",
  "If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.",
  "If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.",
  "Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you\u2019re having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.",
  "Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]",
  "As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn\u2019t just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.",

  "Precision nutrition may sound like a new fad diet, but it is actually a credible emerging area of research supported by the National Institutes of Health under the umbrella of precision medicine. [1,2] Precision medicine seeks to improve the personalized treatment of diseases, and precision nutrition is specific to dietary intake. Both develop interventions to prevent or treat chronic diseases based on a person\u2019s unique characteristics like DNA, race, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Both aim to provide safer and more effective ways to prevent and treat disease by providing more accurate and targeted strategies. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another. How often are we tempted to follow a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or \u201ccure\u201d their diabetes? The concept of precision nutrition would discourage this practice, as our individual blueprint might require a unique dietary plan to be successful.",
  "Precision nutrition, also referred to as personalized nutrition, focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases. Yet, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals. [3] The person\u2019s microbiome was found to cause variations in blood triglycerides after a meal. Non-food factors like sleep, physical activity, and time of meals also played a role in causing variations in blood levels of glucose and triglycerides after meals. [3] Therefore, an individual may see additional benefits if following personalized nutrition guidance beyond general health recommendations. Precision nutrition evaluates one\u2019s DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease.",
  "Other factors being researched include seeing if a high intake of saturated fat may predispose an individual to weight gain, or if a high salt intake increases one\u2019s risk of developing high blood pressure. [7] However, findings from these studies have not been replicated in different populations.",
  "The field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges\u2014a lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual\u2019s DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. [4] Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease. There may also be differences among findings in clinical trials of the individual metabolic response to a specific diet depending on the types of tests they use; this in turn could cause variation in the personalized nutrition recommendations that are provided.",
  "Primary care physicians, registered dietitians, and other providers directly interacting with an individual need to be educated about precision nutrition, as it requires the combined joint efforts of the entire health care team. Despite individual differences in metabolic response to foods, personalized dietary advice should still align with general nutrition principles (e.g. eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming less added sugar from sugary drinks, limiting sodium, etc.). Although private companies have started to offer genetic and microbiome testing to the public to customize diets, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests.",
  "Ethical and legal aspects of implementing precision nutrition should also be considered, including protecting consumer privacy in the use of precision nutrition technologies and tests. It\u2019s also important to recognize that personalized approaches may be accessible to only a small segment of the population, which can widen health disparities. We must not lose sight of improving the broader food environment through effective policies, regulations, and other population-based approaches that can help make healthy food choices the default.",

  "During the flu season or times of illness, people often seek special foods or vitamin supplements that are believed to boost immunity. Vitamin C and foods like citrus fruits, chicken soup, and tea with honey are popular examples. Yet the design of our immune system is complex and influenced by an ideal balance of many factors, not just diet, and especially not by any one specific food or nutrient. However, a balanced diet consisting of a range of vitamins and minerals, combined with healthy lifestyle factors like adequate sleep and exercise and low stress, most effectively primes the body to fight infection and disease.",
  "On a daily basis, we are constantly exposed to potentially harmful microbes of all sorts. Our immune system, a network of intricate stages and pathways in the body, protects us against these harmful microbes as well as certain diseases. It recognizes foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites and takes immediate action. Humans possess two types of immunity: innate and adaptive.",
  "The elderly are a particularly high-risk group. The immune response generally declines with increasing age as the number and quality of immune cells decreases. This causes a higher risk of poorer outcomes if the elderly develop chronic or acute diseases. In addition, about one-third of elderly in industrialized countries have nutrient deficiencies. [8] Some reasons include a poorer appetite due to chronic diseases, depression, or loneliness; multiple medications that can interfere with nutrient absorption and appetite; malabsorption due to intestinal issues; and increased nutrient needs due to hypermetabolic states with acute or chronic conditions. Diet variety may also be limited due to budget constraints or lower interest in cooking for one person; poor dentition; mental impairment; or lack of transportation and community resources to obtain healthy food.",

  "The food environment often lurks silently in the background going largely unnoticed, but it plays a major role in the food choices people make, even for the most independent-minded consumer. Individuals may choose a food based on factors including taste preferences, beliefs about foods, nutritional knowledge, eating behaviors, and income.",
  "Food choices are also influenced by cultural and ethnic norms and social pressures, and many other influences that extend beyond the individual. [6] Whether it\u2019s small victories on the local level or large shifts on the national level, any positive changes to the food environment can begin to shift momentum away from a world that so readily promotes unhealthy eating.",
  "Families with lower incomes face additional barriers to healthy eating. One roadblock is that healthy foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, tend to be more expensive than less healthful foods such as refined grains and sweets. [15] Another is time: It takes longer to prepare meals at home than to buy convenience foods or fast food. People in lower-income households, often single parents working full time and taking care of children, may have less time for meal preparation. [1, 15, 16]",
  "Social norms are rules that define beliefs and behaviors of a group. People may change their food preferences and eating behaviors based on health-based social norms. [17] Some research has found that when participants are exposed to healthy social norms, they report lower preferences for unhealthy foods compared with participants who are exposed to unhealthy norms. Increased exposure to social media that endorses images of low-nutrient processed foods may also lead to greater consumption these foods. [18]",

  "Having greater access to small food stores may increase the risk of obesity. [25] Convenience stores often offer less variety, higher prices, and lower quality produce than supermarkets. [30] When small stores do stock healthier foods, however, people living nearby eat better. [31] If small stores changed the foods they stock, they could have a positive influence on community members\u2019 diets and obesity risks. Convenience stores selling unhealthy snack foods are more likely to locate in low-income neighborhoods and particularly near schools. [30] They\u2019re also found near schools with more Hispanic and Black students, even after accounting for students\u2019 poverty level. [31]",
  "Although eating fast food has been shown to increase caloric intake and the risk of weight gain, it is not as clear that living or working closer to fast-food restaurants has the same effect. [32-34] While some studies have found that living near fast-food restaurants is linked to weight gain, lower intake of vegetables, and less physical activity, other studies have not. [33,35-39] Fast-food restaurants are more likely to locate near schools, and proximity of fast-food restaurants to schools has been linked to weight gain, lower fruit and vegetable intake, and higher soda intake in school children. [40,41]\u00a0",
  "Restaurant, food, and beverage advertising targeted to adolescents almost exclusively promotes energy-dense nutrient-poor products, especially fast food, sugary drinks, candy, and snacks. [42] Exposure to this marketing increases preferences and consumption of these products. Digital marketing through websites, video games, and social media as well as advertising and product placement in supermarkets and schools also contribute to an environment with little uncommercialized space. [43] In 2005, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly called the Institute of Medicine) concluded that food marketing contributes to unhealthy diets and risk of poor health among American children and youth. [44]",
  "Despite this widespread recognition of the negative impact of marketing unhealthy foods, the practice continues unabated. One study found that when children were presented with foods with cartoon characters on the packaging, 73% were more likely to choose the item packaged with these characters compared with the same food without characters. [45] Food marketers are increasingly using sophisticated digital marketing techniques to target youth across a host of platforms, including smartphones, video games, social media, and immersive \u201cvirtual worlds,\u201d prompting public health advocates to call for stronger government regulation and industry self-regulation. [46-48] Furthermore, children are less likely to recognize digital advertising techniques as compared with television advertisements. [43,47] One study demonstrates that when children viewed both \u201cadvergames\u201d and television commercials, advergames produced more positive attitudes towards brands. [49]",
  "In March 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest issued a report card grading the strength of the voluntary food marketing policies of 128 food and entertainment companies. [51] Two-thirds of these companies had no policy whatsoever on marketing to children. Of the existing policies, a majority applied only weak nutrition standards to their marketing efforts. Meanwhile, in the U.S., efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop voluntary, uniform nutrition standards for foods and drinks marketed to children have met strong resistance from industry and have been stymied by Congress. [52] In 2014, the FTC stopped tracking food marketing to children. [53]",
  "Changes in food prices have been linked to changes in how much we eat and our risk of obesity. One study that followed more than 5,000 young adults for 20 years found that lower prices on soda and pizza were associated with higher caloric intake and increased weight. [57] Another found that higher fruit and vegetable prices were associated with greater weight gain over time in young children. [39]",
  "There has been much debate about why the price of sweeteners has dropped. Some researchers have argued that subsidies to corn growers have led to an oversupply of cheap high-fructose corn syrup, which drives higher sweetener consumption. Economic evaluations of this argument have found that direct subsidies currently play a limited role in lowering sweetener prices, although their historical impact on development of the sweetener market may be more important. [55,58]",
  "Although economists debate how much government subsidies to corn growers influence the price of sweeteners, the government can set policies that influence the price and availability of foods that, in turn, influence obesity risk. [59] Taxes are related to a greater decrease in consumption and overweight for children who are already overweight or whose families have a low income. Several cities in the U.S. as well as countries such as Mexico and Chile have implemented various taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. In Philadelphia, the government enacted a $0.15 per ounce tax on all sugary drinks sold within the city. [60] A recent evaluation of this law found that it led to a 51% decrease in sugary drink sales within Philadelphia. [61] However, this decrease was partially offset by a more moderate increase in sugary drink sales (24%) outside of the Philadelphia border. [61]",
  "These economic changes create predictable dietary shifts, called the \u201cnutrition transition.\u201d [63,70] The earliest nutrition patterns were the \u201chunter gatherer\u201d in which people were highly active hunting and foraging for food, and ate diets rich in fibrous plants and protein from lean wild animals; followed by the \u201cearly agriculture\u201d pattern in which famines were common. Today, low and middle-income countries experience less famines as income rises and nutrition improves, and are moving to a pattern of overeating with associated diseases as people have abundant access to low-nutrient ultraprocessed foods and physical activity declines.",

  "Based on existing evidence, promising ECE interventions include those focused on improving the nutritional quality of meals and snacks served in childcare, increasing physical activity opportunities, limiting screen time, and/or providing classroom-based nutrition education. Interventions focusing on children at greatest risk of developing obesity showed highest efficacy, and longer-term follow-up effectiveness studies suggest that booster interventions may be required to ensure that healthy weight is maintained over time. [6,7]",
  "The nutrition and physical activity standards include the following: ensuring meals and snack meet daily nutrition requirements; safe drinking water is freely available to children throughout the day; physical activity is integrated into curricular activities and daily routines; and ensuring that physical activity is not used as a reward or punishment. [10] One national survey indicated that most Head Start programs reported doing more to support healthy eating and physical activity than required by federal guidelines. [11]",

  "That said, research suggests that CACFP is not meeting its full potential as a policy to improve children\u2019s diet quality and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk. Studies have found that CACFP is not reaching everyone who could benefit from it: many childcare programs that could participate in CACFP do not do so, and some are not even aware that the program exists. [21] Other research suggests that providers need more financial support from CACFP as well as training and implementation support to provide foods that are optimal for young children\u2019s diet quality.

  "Proteins are molecules that support everything your body does. From helping you flex your muscles to breaking down nutrients in the foods you eat, proteins are hard at work. Protein synthesis is the process of making new proteins, and it happens constantly inside cells all over your body. Genetic disorders can affect protein structure or function.",
  "Proteins are tiny particles with huge importance \u2014 they help your body do everything necessary to function and stay alive. You can\u2019t see proteins with your eyes, but they\u2019re inside every cell in your body, doing a range of tasks without you even realizing.",
  "To understand what proteins are and what they do for your body, it may help to know a couple terms:",
  "Even though proteins are too small for you to see, scientists consider them large molecules compared with some other types of molecules in your body. Proteins bend and fold into complex, three-dimensional (3D) shapes suited to their specific tasks.",
  "Not all proteins do all these things. And some do other functions that are too numerous to list here. There are many different types of proteins in your body, and each type of protein specializes in one or more specific tasks.",
  "Proteins go by different names depending on what they do. They also fall into some general categories according to their function. Here are some examples:",
  "Proteins are in cells all throughout your body. In fact, any given cell holds several thousands of proteins. Each protein in a cell does a specific job to support your body\u2019s needs.",
  "Proteins are made of amino acids held together by chemical bonds. One protein typically contains hundreds of individual amino acids. You can think of these amino acids like beads on a necklace.

  "This is because proteins don\u2019t last your entire life. Over time, they break down, and you need new ones to keep up with your body\u2019s demands. That\u2019s why you need a constant intake of protein from foods you eat so your body has new building blocks (amino acids) for protein synthesis.",

  "Muscle size increases when a person challenges the muscles to deal with resistance. This resistance could be in the form of lifting a weight, pushing a heavy object, or working against the forces of gravity.",

  "Around the world, governments provide guidance on the balance of foods and drinks that make up a healthy diet. The guidelines vary in how they are presented but the message is similar; a healthy diet is about getting a balance and variety of foods from the main food groups.",
  "The Eatwell Guide shows the proportions that each of the food groups should make up in our diet and is designed to apply to most of us (although not to children under 2 years old as their dietary needs are different).",
  "The main food groups that feature in the Eatwell Guide, are outlined below. Each section has a useful guide to that food group.",
  "The fruit and vegetables group is the biggest in the Eatwell Guide and we are recommended to eat at least 5 A DAY. Diets high in fruit and vegetables are linked to a lower risk of diseases like heart disease, stroke and some types of cancer.",
  "Fruit and vegetables provide a range of essential nutrients and fibre, as well as chemical compounds that occur naturally in plants that may have health benefits. Fruit and vegetables can also help you maintain a healthy weight as they are generally low in calories, so you can have plenty for relatively few calories.",
  "Helena Gibson-Moore, Nutrition Scientist, British Nutrition Foundation\u00a0",

  "Also known as \u2018carbs,\u2019 starchy foods like bread, pasta, potatoes, rice and other grains are one of the main food groups included in healthy dietary guidelines all over the world.\u00a0",
  "Starchy foods are a key source of fibre as well as vitamins and minerals such as iron, calcium, folate and B vitamins. For a healthier diet, we should choose more wholegrains and higher fibre starchy foods, such as wholemeal breads, wholemeal pasta, wholegrain breakfast cereals or oats and potatoes with skins.",
  "Nuts and seeds (plain, unsalted) are included in this food group and contain vitamins, minerals and fibre. They are also high in fat but the majority of this is \u2018healthier\u2019 fat (unsaturated) and are a nutritious option in moderation (keeping portion sizes to just a small handful).",
  "It\u2019s recommended that we eat at least two portions (2 x 140g cooked weight) per week of sustainably sourced fish (fresh, frozen or canned), including a portion of oily fish. Oily fish includes salmon, sardines, mackerel and trout. Fish are\u00a0 sources of lots of vitamins and minerals. In particular, oily fish are natural sources of vitamin D and are the richest source of a special type of fat called long chain omega-3\u2019s, which may help to prevent heart disease.",
  "This food group includes milk, yogurt and cheese as well as plant-based alternatives to these. Dairy foods are an important source of calcium as well as protein, iodine and B vitamins. The nutritional content of dairy alternatives varies depending on what they are made from (such as soya, rice or oats) and whether they are fortified. If having dairy alternatives such as soya or oat milk, it\u2019s best to choose those that are fortified with calcium and ideally other vitamins and minerals.",
  "Dairy foods contain saturated fat, which we\u2019re advised to eat less of (see below).\u00a0 Some studies suggest that despite their saturated fat content, dairy foods like milk, cheese and yogurt have a neutral effect on heart health. However, lower-fat versions of milk, cheese and plain yogurt are also lower in energy (calories) and so can be helpful if you are trying to manage your weight.",
  "All fats are high in calories, even unsaturated fats, so it is important to use them in small amounts to avoid adding more calories than you need.",
  "Foods high in saturated fat, salt and sugar such as crisps, sweets, biscuits, cakes, chocolate and sugary drinks are not within the main food groups of the Eatwell Guide as they are not needed as part of a healthy diet. Sometimes called \u2018treat foods\u2019 we probably all know that these are foods to eat less of. If you do include them, then it is best to have small portions \u2013 for example, those that provide about 100-150kcal such as a small chocolate biscuit bar, 4 small squares of chocolate, 2 small biscuits, a small multipack bag of crisps, a mini muffin or a small chocolate mousse.",
  "When it comes to sugary drinks it is best to swap these for water or sugar free versions.",
  "The main food groups above are the building blocks of a healthy, balanced diet but they can be put together in different ways, based on our culture, preferences and dietary requirements. There are a whole range of different types of eating but the key principles of a healthy dietary pattern run through all of these",
  "Applying these principles to your diet will help make sure it is balanced and healthy. There are a whole range of diets out there in books, in the press and on social media, some of which claim to have specific effects on health or to help with weight loss. It is not always easy to work out whether these diets are healthy \u2013 they may be promoted by doctors or mention scientific studies.\u00a0",
  "The Mediterranean diet is often thought of as one of the healthiest eating patterns and features plenty of fruit, vegetables, pulses, wholegrains, olive oil, fish and smaller amounts of meat, dairy, eggs and sugary foods. A Mediterranean diet contains a higher proportion of fat than other healthy eating patterns, but most of this is unsaturated fats from olive oil, nuts and seeds and oily fish. This style of eating may reduce the risk of heart disease and have other potential health benefits. If this way of eating works for you then that\u2019s great! However, it is not the only way to eat healthily, and may not work for everyone.",
  "Vegetarian and vegan diets have had a lot of interest and some research suggests that these diets may reduce the risk of heart disease. A healthy, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet will typically provide plenty of vegetables, pulses and wholegrains and so be rich in fibre and low in saturated fat.\u00a0",
  "The term \u2018plant-based diet\u2019 is increasingly popular but there is some confusion about what it means. Some people think this refers to a vegetarian or vegan diet, but many authoritative bodies agree that plant-based eating means proportionately choosing more of your foods from plant sources and so is a diet mainly made up of plant foods, but may still include some meat, fish, eggs and dairy foods. Most healthy eating guidelines, including the Eatwell Guide recommend a mainly plant-based diet. The two biggest food groups; fruit and vegetables and starchy foods, are both plant-based and we are also encouraged to eat more beans and pulses and to use plant-based oils and spreads. So you can make your diet more \u2018plant-based\u2019 by including a wider variety of fruits and vegetables, including wholegrains as well as choosing more plant-based sources of protein.",
  "While nutrition recommendations often focus on individual nutrients or food components, food-based advice is important to help people put nutrition recommendations into practice.\u00a0",
  "Governments around the world have developed food-based dietary guidelines to communicate healthy eating recommendations in a nationally and culturally appropriate and practical way. The guidelines typically divide foods into food groups and provide advice on the proportion each of these groups should make up in the diet. Most guidelines also include a range of advice for people on how to put this into practice, including guidance on making healthier choices within the food groups (such as choosing wholegrain foods), how often to eat specific types of food (such as 5 A DAY), information on appropriate portion sizes as well tools such as planners or recipes.",
  "While presentation of national food-based dietary guidance varies from country to country, the dietary pattern they present is broadly similar, with fruit and vegetables and starchy foods making up the largest groups, often with a particular focus on wholegrains. Dairy foods and protein food groups make up a smaller proportion, along with advice to limit foods high in fat, salt and sugar.",
  "UK food-based guidance has been through several iterations over the decades. Most recently, following changes to recommendations on fibre and free sugars in 2015, the government redeveloped the UK model the Eatwell Guide (then the Eatwell Plate) to take these changes into account.\u00a0",
  "Modelling was carried out by scientists at the University of Oxford using data on dietary intakes from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS). Different scientific methods to recalculate the proportions of the food groups in the guide were considered and optimisation modelling using linear programming was selected. This used statistical techniques to model how current diets would need to change to meet current nutrition recommendations \u2013 both nutrient recommendations, such as those for fibre, and food-based recommendations, including 5 A DAY, were incorporated.\u00a0",
  "The results are summarised in Figure 1 below, showing that the proportion of foods from the fruit and vegetables and starchy foods groups would have to increase significantly and that the proportion of foods from all other groups would have to decrease. The food categories within the food groups did not always follow this pattern \u2013 in the \u2018proteins\u2019 food group, the modelling found that beans and pulses would have to increase by 90% and red meat would have to decrease by 78%.",
  "Studies that have looked at the effect of following the Eatwell Guide compared to the average diet in the UK have found that it could significantly improve population health. One analysis carried out in 2016 when the Eatwell Guide was revised found that following the guidance (without increasing energy intake) could potentially avoid 17.8 million years of ill-health or early death (disability adjusted life years or DALYs) over the lifetime of the population.",
  "Much of the benefit seen was due to prevention of type 2 diabetes as well as prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Another analysis carried out in 2020, found that following at least five of the nine Eatwell Guide recommendations reduced mortality risk by approximately 7% as well as reducing carbon emissions by 30% compared to following 2 or fewer of the recommendations.",
  "While there is increasing evidence for the benefits following healthier dietary patterns as set out in the Eatwell Guide and other models, we are a long way from making this a reality. As shown in the studies mentioned above, significant changes in eating habits are needed for current average UK diets to meet Eatwell Guide recommendations. It has been estimated that less than 1% of the population meet all current dietary guidelines and that only about 30% are meeting five or more of the nine specific recommendations in the Eatwell Guide.",
  "Anne de la Hunty, Senior Nutrition Scientist, British Nutrition Foundation",
  "While trend data from the NDNS from 2008-2017 shows that there has been some progress in reducing intakes of free sugars and sugary drinks in recent years, intakes of free sugars, saturated fat and salt remain higher than recommended. There has been no appreciable increase in fruit and vegetable, fish, or fibre intakes. The broad principles of what makes up a healthy diet are well established but the challenge of how to encourage people in the population to take up this advice remains.",

  "A systematic review and meta-analysis looking at dietary quality as assessed by the HEI, AHEI and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores and health outcomes found that higher diet quality according to these methods was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, reduced risk of cardiovascular and cancer incidence and mortality as well as reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative disease.",
  "The Nordic diet focuses on healthier foods that are locally produced in the Nordic region, and which are considered of importance to cultural and gastronomic identity in these countries.

  "Different scores have been developed to define a healthy Nordic diet, including the Baltic Sea Diet score (from Finland), Healthy Nordic Food Index (from Denmark) and the New Nordic Diet score (from Norway). Evidence from observational studies suggest that a Healthy Nordic is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke and a reduced risk of mortality (particularly from cardiovascular disease). Results from a small number of trials also suggest that a Nordic diet may help improve body weight, blood pressure and blood lipids. However, there is a general lack of evidence in non-Nordic populations to support these potentially beneficial effects if such a dietary pattern is adopted more widely.",
  "The Mediterranean diet, which is usually used to refer to the types of diets traditionally consumed in countries such as Italy and Greece, has been the subject of a lot of research over recent decades.

While these differ in exactly what is measured and how the score is calculated, higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, cereals, olive oil and fish and lower intakes of meat, dairy foods eggs and sugar are generally included. Research suggests that greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet may be associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, lower levels of inflammation and a reduced risk of cognitive decline.",
  "Plant-based diets have been the subject of much popular and scientific discussion in recent years. A set of plant-based diet indices have been developed as a research tool to investigate the health effects of such diets.

  "In a study looking at body weight in three large cohort studies, researchers found that a higher PDI score was associated with greater weight loss, but that this effect was greater with the hPDI score than the uPDI score. Another study looked at the association between these plant-based indices and risk of type 2 diabetes. The overall PDI score was associated with reduced risk although this was attenuated when it was controlled for body mass index (BMI). The hPDI score was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and the relationship remained after controlling for BMI. Conversely the uPDI score was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. A similar pattern was seen in a study looking at risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The overall PDI score was associated with reduced risk of CHD, with a greater reduction seen with the hPDI score. Whereas the uPDI score was associated with increased risk of CHD.",

  "Two other major studies narrowed the prescription slightly, concluding that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats like vegetable oils or high-fiber carbohydrates is the best bet for reducing the risk of heart disease, but replacing saturated fat with highly processed carbohydrates could do the opposite.",
  "Good fats come mainly from vegetables, nuts, seeds, and fish. They differ from saturated fats by having fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to their carbon chains. Healthy fats are liquid at room temperature, not solid. There are two broad categories of beneficial fats: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.",
  "Good sources of monounsaturated fats are olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, and most nuts, as well as high-oleic safflower and sunflower oils.",
  "Although there's no recommended daily intake of monounsaturated fats, the National Academy of Medicine recommends using them as much as possible along with polyunsaturated fats to replace saturated and trans fats.",
  "Eating polyunsaturated fats in place of saturated fats or highly refined carbohydrates reduces harmful LDL cholesterol and improves the cholesterol profile. It also lowers triglycerides.",
  "Good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, flaxseeds, walnuts, canola oil, and un-hydrogenated soybean oil. Foods rich in linoleic acid and other omega-6 fatty acids include vegetable oils such as safflower, soybean, sunflower, walnut, and corn oils.",

  "Frozen fruits and vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh, maybe even more so since they\u2019re frozen at the peak of freshness. \u201cThe big thing you need to watch out for is added salt and sugars,\u201d says Dr. Wolf. \u201cRead the labels and only buy frozen produce that is free of any additives.\u201d",
  "Choosing organic produce can reduce the risk of exposure to pesticides and other chemicals, but it comes at a price. Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If you eat the whole item (berries, lettuce, apples, grapes, peppers etc.), choose organic. If you\u2019re peeling it before eating (pineapples, bananas, onions, melon), then conventional is probably okay.",

Now we\u2019ve totally changed our tune and fat is good,\u201d says Dr. Wolf. \u201cAlthough low-fat can be beneficial in some instances such as dairy, we need fat in our daily diet to be healthy.\u201d Good sources include nuts and seeds, avocados, olives and olive oil. Even getting some fat from a piece of grass-fed steak is better than getting the same amount from a cupcake or a donut. ",
